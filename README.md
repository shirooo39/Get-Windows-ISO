# About
This is just an extremely simple github-pages that I created for learning web development (I know I'm suck and codes look like garbage, but please don't laugh at it. I'm a complete beginner). Created using an updated fork of Daemonite's Material UI for Bootstrap 4, djibe's Material UI 2 for Bootstrap 4.<br>
ISOs are only for the English (US) language and 100% clean, untouched, and has been hash (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) verified!
<br><br>
Please keep in mind that I do NOT accept any request!<br>
I made this page solely for my personal backup of the ISOs, but then I decided to open it to public.
<br><br>
ISOs are NOT pre-activated, nor you'd be able to find any kinds of free license key or activator that you can use to active Windows for free! This page is NOT a piracy page!
